description: The following analytic identifies discrepancies between the IP address
  of an authentication event and the IP address of the verification response event,
  focusing on differences in the originating countries. It leverages JSON logs from
  PingID, comparing the 'auth_Country' and 'verify_Country' fields. This activity
  is significant as it may indicate suspicious sign-in behavior, such as account compromise
  or unauthorized access attempts. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to bypass authentication mechanisms, potentially leading to unauthorized access
  to sensitive systems and data.
