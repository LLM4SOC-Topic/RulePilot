description: The following analytic detects the correlation between the user and risk
  score and identifies users with a high risk score that pose a significant security
  risk such as unauthorized access attempts, suspicious behavior, or potential insider
  threats. Next, the analytic calculates the sum of the risk scores and groups the
  results by user, the corresponding signals, and the repository. The results are
  sorted in descending order based on the risk score and filtered to include records
  with a risk score greater than 80. Finally, the results are passed through a correlation
  filter specific to the user and risk. This detection is important because it identifies
  users who have a high risk score and helps to prioritize investigations and allocate
  resources. False positives might occur but the impact of such an attack can vary
  depending on the specific scenario such as data exfiltration, system compromise,
  or the disruption of critical services. Please investigate this notable event.
