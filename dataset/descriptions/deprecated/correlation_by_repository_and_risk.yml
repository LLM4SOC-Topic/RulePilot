description: This search has been deprecated and updated with Risk Rule for Dev Sec
  Ops by Repository detection. The following analytic detects by correlating repository
  and risk score to identify patterns and trends in the data based on the level of
  risk associated. The analytic adds any null values and calculates the sum of the
  risk scores for each detection. Then, the analytic captures the source and user
  information for each detection and sorts the results in ascending order based on
  the risk score. Finally, the analytic filters the detections with a risk score below
  80 and focuses only on high-risk detections.This detection is important because
  it provides valuable insights into the distribution of high-risk activities across
  different repositories. It also identifies the most vulnerable repositories that
  are frequently targeted by potential threats. Additionally, it proactively detects
  and responds to potential threats, thereby minimizing the impact of attacks and
  safeguarding critical assets. Finally, it provides a comprehensive view of the risk
  landscape and helps to make informed decisions to protect the organization's data
  and infrastructure. False positives might occur so it is important to identify the
  impact of the attack and prioritize response and mitigation efforts.
