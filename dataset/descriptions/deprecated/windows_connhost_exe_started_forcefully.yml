description: The search looks for the Console Window Host process (connhost.exe) executed
  using the force flag -ForceV1. This is not regular behavior in the Windows OS and
  is often seen executed by the Ryuk Ransomware. DEPRECATED This event is actually
  seen in the windows 10 client of attack_range_local. After further testing we realized
  this is not specific to Ryuk.
