description: The following analytic identifies significant legal liability threats
  blocked by the Zscaler web proxy. It uses web proxy logs to track destinations,
  device owners, users, URL categories, and actions associated with legal liability.
  By leveraging statistics on unique fields, it ensures a precise focus on these threats.
  This activity is significant for SOC as it helps enforce legal compliance and risk
  management. If confirmed malicious, it could indicate attempts to access legally
  sensitive or restricted content, potentially leading to legal repercussions and
  compliance violations.
