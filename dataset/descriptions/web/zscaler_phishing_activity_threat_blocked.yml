  by Zscaler within a network. It leverages web proxy logs to detect actions tagged
  as HTML.Phish. The detection method involves analyzing critical data points such
  as user, threat name, URL, and hostname. This activity is significant for a SOC
  as it serves as an early warning system for phishing threats, enabling prompt investigation
  and mitigation. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate an attempt
  to deceive users into divulging sensitive information, potentially leading to data
  breaches or credential theft.
