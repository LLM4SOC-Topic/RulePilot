description: The following analytic identifies web activity related to employment
  searches within a network. It leverages Zscaler web proxy logs, focusing on entries
  categorized as 'Job/Employment Search'. Key data points such as device owner, user,
  URL category, destination URL, and IP are analyzed. This detection is significant
  for SOCs as it helps monitor potential insider threats by identifying users who
  may be seeking new employment. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate
  a risk of data exfiltration or other insider threats, potentially leading to sensitive
  information leakage or other security breaches.
