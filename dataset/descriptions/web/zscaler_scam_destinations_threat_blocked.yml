description: The following analytic identifies blocked scam-related activities detected
  by Zscaler within a network. It leverages web proxy logs to examine actions flagged
  as scam threats, focusing on data points such as device owner, user, URL category,
  destination URL, and IP. This detection is significant for SOC as it helps in the
  early identification and mitigation of scam activities, ensuring network safety.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate attempts to deceive users,
  potentially leading to data theft or financial loss.
