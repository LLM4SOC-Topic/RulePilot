description: The following analytic identifies remote code execution (RCE) attempts
  targeting F5 BIG-IP, BIG-IQ, and Traffix SDC devices, specifically exploiting CVE-2020-5902.
  It uses regex to detect patterns in syslog data that match known exploit strings
  such as "hsqldb;" and directory traversal sequences. This activity is significant
  because successful exploitation can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands
  on the affected devices, leading to full system compromise. If confirmed malicious,
  this could result in unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further lateral
  movement within the network.
