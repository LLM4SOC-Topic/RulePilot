description: The following analytic detects suspicious calendar invites sent via GSuite,
  potentially indicating compromised accounts or malicious internal activity. It leverages
  GSuite calendar logs, focusing on events where a high volume of invites (over 100)
  is sent within a 5-minute window. This behavior is significant as it may involve
  the distribution of malicious links or attachments, posing a security risk. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could lead to widespread phishing attacks, unauthorized
  access, or malware distribution within the organization.
