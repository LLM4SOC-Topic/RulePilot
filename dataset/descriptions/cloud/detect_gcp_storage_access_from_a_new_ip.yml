description: The following analytic identifies access to GCP Storage buckets from
  new or previously unseen remote IP addresses. It leverages GCP Storage bucket-access
  logs ingested via Cloud Pub/Sub and compares current access events against a lookup
  table of previously seen IP addresses. This activity is significant as it may indicate
  unauthorized access or potential reconnaissance by an attacker. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized data manipulation, or further
  compromise of the GCP environment.
