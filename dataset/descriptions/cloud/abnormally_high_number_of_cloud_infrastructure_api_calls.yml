description: The following analytic detects a spike in the number of API calls made
  to your cloud infrastructure by a user. It leverages cloud infrastructure logs and
  compares the current API call volume against a baseline probability density function
  to identify anomalies. This activity is significant because an unusual increase
  in API calls can indicate potential misuse or compromise of cloud resources. If
  confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration,
  or disruption of cloud services, posing a significant risk to the organization's
  cloud environment.
