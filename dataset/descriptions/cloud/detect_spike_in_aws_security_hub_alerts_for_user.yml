description: The following analytic identifies a spike in the number of AWS Security
  Hub alerts for an AWS IAM User within a 4-hour interval. It leverages AWS Security
  Hub findings data, calculating the average and standard deviation of alerts to detect
  significant deviations. This activity is significant as a sudden increase in alerts
  for a specific user may indicate suspicious behavior or a potential security incident.
  If confirmed malicious, this could signify an ongoing attack, unauthorized access,
  or misuse of IAM credentials, potentially leading to data breaches or further exploitation.
