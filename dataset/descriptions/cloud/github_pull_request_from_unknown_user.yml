description: The following analytic detects pull requests from unknown users on GitHub.
  It uses a Splunk query to identify pull requests where the user ID is not specified
  and cross-references these with a known users lookup table. This activity is significant
  because pull requests from unknown users can introduce malicious code or unauthorized
  changes to repositories. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  code changes, data breaches, or other security incidents. Immediate steps include
  reviewing the author's name, repository, head reference, and commit message, and
  investigating any related artifacts and processes.
