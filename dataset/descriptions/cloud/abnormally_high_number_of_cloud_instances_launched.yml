description: The following analytic detects an abnormally high number of cloud instances
  launched within a 4-hour period. It leverages cloud infrastructure logs and applies
  a probability density model to identify outliers based on historical data. This
  activity is significant for a SOC because a sudden spike in instance creation could
  indicate unauthorized access or misuse of cloud resources. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could lead to resource exhaustion, increased costs, or provide attackers
  with additional compute resources to further their objectives.
