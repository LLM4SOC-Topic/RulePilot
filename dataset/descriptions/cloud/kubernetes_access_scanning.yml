description: The following analytic detects potential scanning activities within a
  Kubernetes environment. It identifies unauthorized access attempts, probing of public
  APIs, or attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities by monitoring Kubernetes audit
  logs for repeated failed access attempts or unusual API requests. This activity
  is significant for a SOC as it may indicate an attacker's preliminary reconnaissance
  to gather information about the system. If confirmed malicious, this activity could
  lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data, posing a severe security
  risk.
