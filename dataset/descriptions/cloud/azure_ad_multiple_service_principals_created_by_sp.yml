description: The following analytic detects when a single service principal in Azure
  AD creates more than three unique OAuth applications within a 10-minute span. It
  leverages Azure AD audit logs, specifically monitoring the 'Add service principal'
  operation initiated by service principals. This behavior is significant as it may
  indicate an attacker using a compromised or malicious service principal to rapidly
  establish multiple service principals, potentially staging an attack. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could facilitate network infiltration or expansion, allowing
  the attacker to gain unauthorized access and persist within the environment.
