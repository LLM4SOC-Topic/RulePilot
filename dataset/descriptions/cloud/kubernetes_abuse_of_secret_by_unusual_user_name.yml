description: The following analytic detects unauthorized access or misuse of Kubernetes
  Secrets by unusual user names. It leverages Kubernetes Audit logs to identify anomalies
  in access patterns by analyzing the source of requests based on user names. This
  activity is significant for a SOC as Kubernetes Secrets store sensitive information
  like passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys, making them critical assets. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems
  or data, potentially resulting in significant security breaches and exfiltration
  of sensitive information.
