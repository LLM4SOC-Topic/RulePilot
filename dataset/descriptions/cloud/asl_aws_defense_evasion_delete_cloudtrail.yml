description: The following analytic detects AWS `DeleteTrail` events within CloudTrail
  logs. It leverages Amazon Security Lake logs parsed in the Open Cybersecurity Schema
  Framework (OCSF) format to identify when a CloudTrail is deleted. This activity
  is significant because adversaries may delete CloudTrail logs to evade detection
  and operate with stealth. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers
  to cover their tracks, making it difficult to trace their activities and investigate
  other potential compromises within the AWS environment.
