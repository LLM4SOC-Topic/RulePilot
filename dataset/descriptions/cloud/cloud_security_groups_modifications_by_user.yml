description: The following analytic identifies unusual modifications to security groups
  in your cloud environment by users, focusing on actions such as modifications, deletions,
  or creations over 30-minute intervals. It leverages cloud infrastructure logs and
  calculates the standard deviation for each user, using the 3-sigma rule to detect
  anomalies. This activity is significant as it may indicate a compromised account
  or insider threat. If confirmed malicious, attackers could alter security group
  configurations, potentially exposing sensitive resources or disrupting services.
