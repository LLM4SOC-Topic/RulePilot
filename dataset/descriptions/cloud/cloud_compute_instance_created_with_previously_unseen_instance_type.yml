description: The following analytic detects the creation of EC2 instances with previously
  unseen instance types. It leverages Splunk's tstats command to analyze data from
  the Change data model, identifying instance types that have not been previously
  recorded. This activity is significant for a SOC because it may indicate unauthorized
  or suspicious activity, such as an attacker attempting to create instances for malicious
  purposes. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration,
  system compromise, or service disruption. Immediate investigation is required to
  determine the legitimacy of the instance creation.
