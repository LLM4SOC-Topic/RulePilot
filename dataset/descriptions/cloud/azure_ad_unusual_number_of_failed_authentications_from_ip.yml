description: The following analytic identifies a single source IP failing to authenticate
  with multiple valid users, potentially indicating a Password Spraying attack against
  an Azure Active Directory tenant. It uses Azure SignInLogs data and calculates the
  standard deviation for source IPs, applying the 3-sigma rule to detect unusual numbers
  of failed authentication attempts. This activity is significant as it may signal
  an adversary attempting to gain initial access or elevate privileges. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potential
  compromise of sensitive information.
