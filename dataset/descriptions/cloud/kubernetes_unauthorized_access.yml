description: The following analytic detects unauthorized access attempts to Kubernetes
  by analyzing Kubernetes audit logs. It identifies anomalies in access patterns by
  examining the source of requests and their response statuses. This activity is significant
  for a SOC as it may indicate an attacker attempting to infiltrate the Kubernetes
  environment. If confirmed malicious, such access could lead to unauthorized control
  over Kubernetes resources, potentially compromising sensitive systems or data within
  the cluster.
