description: The following analytic identifies the creation of containerized workloads
  using previously unseen images in a Kubernetes cluster. It leverages process metrics
  from an OTEL collector and Kubernetes cluster receiver, pulled from Splunk Observability
  Cloud. The detection compares container image names seen in the last hour with those
  from the previous 30 days. This activity is significant as unfamiliar container
  images may introduce vulnerabilities, malware, or misconfigurations, posing threats
  to the cluster's integrity. If confirmed malicious, compromised images can lead
  to data breaches, service disruptions, unauthorized access, and potential lateral
  movement within the cluster.
