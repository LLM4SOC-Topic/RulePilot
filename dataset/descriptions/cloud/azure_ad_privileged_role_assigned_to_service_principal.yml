description: The following analytic detects the assignment of privileged roles to
  service principals in Azure Active Directory (AD). It leverages the AuditLogs log
  category from ingested Azure AD events. This activity is significant because assigning
  elevated permissions to non-human entities can lead to unauthorized access or malicious
  activities. If confirmed malicious, attackers could exploit these service principals
  to gain elevated access to Azure resources, potentially compromising sensitive data
  and critical infrastructure. Monitoring this behavior helps prevent privilege escalation
  and ensures the security of Azure environments.
