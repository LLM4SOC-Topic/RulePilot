description: The following analytic detects suspicious attachment file extensions
  in GSuite emails, potentially indicating a spear-phishing attack. It leverages GSuite
  Gmail logs to identify emails with attachments having file extensions commonly associated
  with malware, such as .exe, .bat, and .js. This activity is significant as these
  file types are often used to deliver malicious payloads, posing a risk of compromising
  targeted machines. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code
  execution, data breaches, or further network infiltration.
