description: The following analytic identifies when a malicious file is detected within
  the Microsoft Office 365 ecosystem through the Advanced Threat Protection engine.
  Attackers may stage and execute malicious files from within the Microsoft Office
  365 ecosystem. Any detections from built-in Office 365 capabilities should be monitored
  and responded to appropriately. Certain premium Office 365 capabilities such as
  Safe Attachment and Safe Links further enhance these detection and response functions.
