description: The following analytic identifies instances where admin consent is granted
  to an application within an Azure AD and Office 365 tenant. It leverages O365 audit
  logs, specifically events related to the admin consent action within the AzureActiveDirectory
  workload. This activity is significant because admin consent allows applications
  to access data across the entire tenant, potentially exposing vast amounts of organizational
  data. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain extensive and persistent access
  to organizational data, leading to data exfiltration, espionage, further malicious
  activities, and potential compliance violations.
