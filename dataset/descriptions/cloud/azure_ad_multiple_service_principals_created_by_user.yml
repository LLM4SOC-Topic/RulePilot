description: The following analytic identifies instances where a single user creates
  more than three unique OAuth applications within a 10-minute timeframe in Azure
  AD. It detects this activity by monitoring the 'Add service principal' operation
  and aggregating data in 10-minute intervals. This behavior is significant as it
  may indicate an adversary rapidly creating multiple service principals to stage
  an attack or expand their foothold within the network. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could allow attackers to establish persistence, escalate privileges, or
  access sensitive information within the Azure environment.
