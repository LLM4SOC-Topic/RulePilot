description: The following analytic detects instances where Java, Apache, or Tomcat
  processes spawn a Linux shell, which may indicate exploitation attempts, such as
  those related to CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell). This detection leverages Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process names and parent-child process
  relationships. This activity is significant as it can signify a compromised Java
  application, potentially leading to unauthorized shell access. If confirmed malicious,
  attackers could execute arbitrary commands, escalate privileges, or maintain persistent
  access, posing a severe threat to the environment.
