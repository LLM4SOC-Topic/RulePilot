description: The following analytic detects the execution of a command to enable all
  SysRq functions on a Linux system, a technique associated with the AwfulShred malware.
  It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data to identify processes executing
  the command to pipe bitmask '1' to /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq. This activity is significant
  as it can indicate an attempt to manipulate kernel system requests, which is uncommon
  and potentially malicious. If confirmed, this could allow an attacker to reboot
  the system or perform other critical actions, leading to system instability or further
  compromise.
