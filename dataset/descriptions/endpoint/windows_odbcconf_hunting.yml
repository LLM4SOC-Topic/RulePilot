description: The following analytic identifies the execution of Odbcconf.exe within
  the environment. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process creation events where the process name is Odbcconf.exe. This
  activity is significant because Odbcconf.exe can be used by attackers to execute
  arbitrary commands or load malicious DLLs, potentially leading to code execution
  or persistence. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to
  maintain access to the system, execute further malicious activities, or escalate
  privileges, posing a significant threat to the environment.
