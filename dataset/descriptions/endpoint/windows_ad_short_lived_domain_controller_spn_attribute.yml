description: The following analytic detects the temporary addition of a global catalog
  SPN or a DRS RPC SPN to an Active Directory computer object, indicative of a potential
  DCShadow attack. This detection leverages EventCode 5136 from the `wineventlog_security`
  data source, focusing on specific SPN attribute changes. This activity is significant
  as DCShadow attacks allow attackers with privileged access to register rogue Domain
  Controllers, enabling unauthorized changes to the AD infrastructure. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized replication of changes, including credentials
  and keys, compromising the entire domain's security.
