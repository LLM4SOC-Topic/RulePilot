description: The following analytic identifies the use of taskkill.exe to forcibly
  terminate processes. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on command-line executions that include specific taskkill parameters.
  This activity is significant because it can indicate attempts to disable security
  tools or disrupt legitimate applications, a common tactic in malware operations.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to evade detection,
  disrupt system stability, and potentially gain further control over the compromised
  system.
