description: The following analytic detects suspicious data transfer activities that
  involve the use of the `split` syscall, potentially indicating an attempt to evade
  detection by breaking large files into smaller parts. Attackers may use this technique
  to bypass size-based security controls, facilitating the covert exfiltration of
  sensitive data. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized use of the `split` syscall,
  this analytic helps identify potential data exfiltration attempts, allowing security
  teams to intervene and prevent the unauthorized transfer of critical information
  from the network.
