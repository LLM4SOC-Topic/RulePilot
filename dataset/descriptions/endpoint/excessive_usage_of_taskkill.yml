description: The following analytic identifies excessive usage of `taskkill.exe`,
  a command-line utility used to terminate processes. The detection leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on instances where `taskkill.exe`
  is executed ten or more times within a one-minute span. This behavior is significant
  as adversaries often use `taskkill.exe` to disable security tools or other critical
  processes to evade detection. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow
  attackers to bypass security defenses, maintain persistence, and further compromise
  the system.
