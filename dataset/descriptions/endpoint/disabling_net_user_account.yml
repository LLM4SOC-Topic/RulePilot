description: The following analytic detects the use of the `net.exe` utility to disable
  a user account via the command line. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs and command-line arguments.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary's attempt to disrupt
  user availability, potentially as a precursor to further malicious actions. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to denial of service for legitimate users, aiding the
  attacker in maintaining control or covering their tracks.
