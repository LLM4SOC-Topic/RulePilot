description: The following analytic detects the execution of the 'csvtool' command
  with 'sudo' privileges, which can allow a user to run system commands as root. This
  detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process execution logs that include command-line details. This activity is significant
  because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, where a user could
  gain unauthorized root access. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system
  compromise, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, escalate privileges,
  and maintain persistent access.
