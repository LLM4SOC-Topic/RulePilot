description: The following analytic identifies unauthorized Active Directory replication
  requests initiated from non-domain controller locations. It leverages EventCode
  4662 to detect when a computer account with replication permissions creates a handle
  to domainDNS, filtering out known domain controller IP addresses. This activity
  is significant as it may indicate a DCSync attack, where an attacker with privileged
  access can request password hashes for any or all users within the domain. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential
  full domain compromise.
