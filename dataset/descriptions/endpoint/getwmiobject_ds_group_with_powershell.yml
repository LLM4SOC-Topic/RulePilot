description: The following analytic identifies the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  command-line arguments used to query domain groups via the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet
  and the `-class ds_group` parameter. This detection leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line
  executions. This activity is significant as it indicates potential reconnaissance
  efforts by adversaries to enumerate domain groups, which is a common step in Active
  Directory Discovery. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to gain
  insights into the domain structure, aiding in further attacks and privilege escalation.
