description: The following analytic detects the execution of the RPM Package Manager
  with elevated privileges, specifically when it is used to run system commands as
  root via the `--eval` and `lua:os.execute` options. This detection leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions
  and process metadata. This activity is significant because it indicates a potential
  privilege escalation attempt, allowing a user to gain root access. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to full system compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive
  data, and further exploitation of the environment.
