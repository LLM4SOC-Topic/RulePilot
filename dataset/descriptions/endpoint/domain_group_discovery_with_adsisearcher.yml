description: The following analytic detects the use of the `[Adsisearcher]` type accelerator
  in PowerShell to query Active Directory for domain groups. It leverages PowerShell
  Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify specific script blocks containing
  `[adsisearcher]` and group-related queries. This activity is significant as it may
  indicate an attempt by adversaries or Red Teams to enumerate domain groups for situational
  awareness and Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could lead to further reconnaissance, privilege escalation, or lateral movement
  within the network.
