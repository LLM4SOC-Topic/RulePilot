description: The following analytic identifies the execution of the Windows command
  line to reboot a host machine using "shutdown.exe" with specific parameters. This
  detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant as it
  is often associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs) and remote access trojans
  (RATs) like dcrat, which may use system reboots to disrupt operations, aid in system
  destruction, or inhibit recovery. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to system
  downtime, data loss, or hindered incident response efforts.
