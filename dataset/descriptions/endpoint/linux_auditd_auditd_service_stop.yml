description: The following analytic detects the suspicious auditd service stop. This
  behavior is critical for a SOC to monitor because it may indicate attempts to gain
  unauthorized access or maintain control over a system. Such actions could be signs
  of malicious activity. If confirmed, this could lead to serious consequences, including
  a compromised system, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or even a wider breach
  affecting the entire network. Detecting and responding to these signs early is essential
  to prevent potential security incidents.
