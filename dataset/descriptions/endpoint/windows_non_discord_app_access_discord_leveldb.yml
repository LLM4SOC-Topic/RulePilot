description: The following analytic detects non-Discord applications accessing the
  Discord LevelDB database. It leverages Windows Security Event logs, specifically
  event code 4663, to identify file access attempts to the LevelDB directory by processes
  other than Discord. This activity is significant as it may indicate attempts to
  steal Discord credentials or access sensitive user data. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to unauthorized access to user profiles, messages, and other critical
  information, potentially compromising the security and privacy of the affected users.
