description: The following analytic detects the use of the `curl` command with proxy-related
  arguments such as `-x`, `socks`, `--preproxy`, and `--proxy`. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line
  executions and process details. This activity is significant as it may indicate
  an adversary attempting to use a proxy to evade network monitoring and obscure their
  actions. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to bypass security
  controls, making it difficult to track their activities and potentially leading
  to unauthorized data access or exfiltration.
