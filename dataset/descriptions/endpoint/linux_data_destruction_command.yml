description: The following analytic detects the execution of a Unix shell command
  designed to wipe root directories on a Linux host. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on the 'rm' command with force recursive
  deletion and the '--no-preserve-root' option. This activity is significant as it
  indicates potential data destruction attempts, often associated with malware like
  Awfulshred. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to severe data loss,
  system instability, and compromised integrity of the affected Linux host. Immediate
  investigation and response are crucial to mitigate potential damage.
