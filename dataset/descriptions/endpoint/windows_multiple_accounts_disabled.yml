description: The following analytic identifies instances where more than five unique
  Windows accounts are disabled within a 10-minute window, as indicated by Event Code
  4725 in the Windows Security Event Log. It leverages the wineventlog_security dataset,
  grouping data into 10-minute segments and tracking the count and distinct count
  of TargetUserName. This behavior is significant as it may indicate internal policy
  breaches or an external attacker's attempt to disrupt operations. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could lead to widespread account lockouts, hindering user access and
  potentially disrupting business operations.
