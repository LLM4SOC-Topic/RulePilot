description: The following analytic detects the use of the LD_PRELOAD environment
  variable to hijack or hook library functions on a Linux platform. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution
  logs that include command-line details. This activity is significant because adversaries,
  malware authors, and red teamers commonly use this technique to gain elevated privileges
  and establish persistence on a compromised machine. If confirmed malicious, this
  behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, and
  maintain long-term access to the system.
