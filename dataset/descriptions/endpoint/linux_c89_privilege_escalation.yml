description: The following analytic detects the execution of the 'c89' command with
  elevated privileges, which can be used to compile and execute C programs as root.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process creation events that include command-line arguments. This activity
  is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, allowing
  a user to execute arbitrary commands as root. If confirmed malicious, this could
  lead to full system compromise, enabling the attacker to gain root access and execute
  any command with elevated privileges.
