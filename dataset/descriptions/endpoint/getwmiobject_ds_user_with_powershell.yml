description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  command-line arguments used to query domain users via the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet
  and `-class ds_user` parameter. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions.
  This activity is significant as it indicates potential reconnaissance efforts by
  adversaries to enumerate domain users, which is a common step in Active Directory
  Discovery. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to further attacks, including
  privilege escalation and lateral movement within the network.
