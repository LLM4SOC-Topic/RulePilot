description: The following analytic identifies instances where mshta.exe has been
  renamed and executed. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, specifically
  focusing on the original file name field to detect discrepancies. This activity
  is significant because renaming mshta.exe is a common tactic used by attackers to
  evade detection and execute malicious scripts. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise,
  data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network.
