description: The following analytic identifies a single source endpoint failing to
  authenticate with 30 unique users using the Kerberos protocol. It leverages EventCode
  4771 with Status 0x18, indicating wrong password attempts, and aggregates these
  events over a 5-minute window. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a
  Password Spraying attack, where an adversary attempts to gain initial access or
  elevate privileges in an Active Directory environment. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potential
  compromise of sensitive information.
