description: The following analytic detects the execution of the sqlite3 command with
  elevated privileges, which can be exploited for privilege escalation. It leverages
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry to identify instances where sqlite3
  is used in conjunction with shell commands and sudo. This activity is significant
  because it indicates a potential attempt to gain root access, which could lead to
  full system compromise. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could execute arbitrary
  commands as root, leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further
  lateral movement within the network.
