description: The following analytic detects potential access or modification of the
  /etc/sudoers file on a Linux system. It leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing
  on processes like "cat," "nano," "vim," and "vi" accessing the /etc/sudoers file.
  This activity is significant because the sudoers file controls user permissions
  for executing commands with elevated privileges. If confirmed malicious, an attacker
  could gain persistence or escalate privileges, compromising the security of the
  targeted host.
