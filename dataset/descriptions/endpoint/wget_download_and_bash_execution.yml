description: The following analytic detects the use of wget on Windows, Linux or MacOS
  to download a file from a remote source and pipe it to bash. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names
  and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it is commonly associated
  with malicious actions like coinminers and exploits such as CVE-2021-44228 in Log4j.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code, potentially leading to system compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive
  data.
