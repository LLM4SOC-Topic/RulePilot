description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-ADUser` PowerShell
  cmdlet with parameters indicating a search for domain accounts with Kerberos Pre-Authentication
  disabled. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify
  this specific activity. This behavior is significant because discovering accounts
  with Kerberos Pre-Authentication disabled can allow adversaries to perform offline
  password cracking. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized
  access to user accounts, potentially compromising sensitive information and escalating
  privileges within the network.
