description: The following analytic identifies the issuance of a new certificate by
  Certificate Services - AD CS, detected via Event ID 4887. This event logs the requester
  user context, DNS hostname of the requesting machine, and the request time. Monitoring
  this activity is crucial as it can indicate potential misuse of authentication certificates.
  If confirmed malicious, an attacker could use the issued certificate to impersonate
  users, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence within the environment. This
  detection helps in identifying and correlating suspicious certificate-related activities
  for further investigation.
