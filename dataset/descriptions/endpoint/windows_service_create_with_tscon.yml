description: The following analytic detects potential RDP Hijacking attempts by identifying
  the creation of a Windows service using sc.exe with a binary path that includes
  tscon.exe. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process creation events and command-line arguments. This activity
  is significant as it indicates an attacker may be trying to hijack a disconnected
  RDP session, posing a risk of unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, the attacker
  could gain control over an existing user session, leading to potential data theft
  or further system compromise.
