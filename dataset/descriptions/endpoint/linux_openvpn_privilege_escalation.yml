description: The following analytic detects the execution of OpenVPN with elevated
  privileges, specifically when combined with the `--dev`, `--script-security`, `--up`,
  and `sudo` options. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process command-line arguments and execution details.
  This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation
  attempt, allowing a user to execute system commands as root. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to full system compromise, enabling an attacker to gain root access
  and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.
