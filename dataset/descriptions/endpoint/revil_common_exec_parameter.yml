description: The following analytic detects the execution of command-line parameters
  commonly associated with REVIL ransomware, such as "-nolan", "-nolocal", "-fast",
  and "-full". It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process execution logs mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. This activity is significant because these parameters are indicative
  of ransomware attempting to encrypt files on a compromised machine. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to widespread data encryption, rendering critical files
  inaccessible and potentially causing significant operational disruption.
