description: The following analytic detects the execution of programs initiated by
  forfiles.exe. This command is typically used to run commands on multiple files,
  often within batch scripts. The detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events where forfiles.exe
  is the parent process. This activity is significant because forfiles.exe can be
  exploited to bypass command line execution protections, making it a potential vector
  for malicious activity. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute
  arbitrary commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further system
  compromise.
