description: The following analytic detects instances where more than five unique
  Windows account passwords are changed within a 10-minute interval. It leverages
  Event Code 4724 from the Windows Security Event Log, using the wineventlog_security
  dataset to monitor and count distinct TargetUserName values. This behavior is significant
  as rapid password changes across multiple accounts are unusual and may indicate
  unauthorized access or internal compromise. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could lead to widespread account compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive information,
  and potential disruption of services.
