description: The following analytic detects the execution of the 'doas' tool on a
  Linux host. This tool allows standard users to perform tasks with root privileges,
  similar to 'sudo'. The detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity
  is significant as 'doas' can be exploited by adversaries to gain elevated privileges
  on a compromised host. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized administrative
  access, potentially compromising the entire system.
