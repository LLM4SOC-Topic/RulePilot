description: The following analytic detects a user account initiating an Active Directory
  replication request, indicative of a DCSync attack. It leverages EventCode 4662
  from the Windows Security Event Log, focusing on specific object types and replication
  permissions. This activity is significant because it can allow an attacker with
  sufficient privileges to request password hashes for any or all users within the
  domain. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, privilege
  escalation, and potential compromise of the entire domain.
