description: The following analytic detects the execution of `wmic.exe` with command-line
  arguments used to query local user accounts, specifically the `useraccount` argument.
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  process execution logs that include command-line details. This activity is significant
  as it indicates potential reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to enumerate local
  users, which is a common step in situational awareness and Active Directory discovery.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to further targeted attacks, privilege
  escalation, or lateral movement within the network.
