description: The following analytic identifies suspicious child processes spawned
  by calc.exe, indicative of DLL side-loading techniques. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process GUIDs,
  names, and parent processes. This activity is significant as it is commonly associated
  with Qakbot malware, which uses calc.exe to load malicious DLLs via regsvr32.exe.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code, maintain persistence, and escalate privileges, posing a severe threat to the
  environment.
