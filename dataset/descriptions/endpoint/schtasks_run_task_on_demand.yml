description: The following analytic detects the execution of a Windows Scheduled Task
  on demand via the shell or command line. It leverages process-related data, including
  process name, parent process, and command-line executions, sourced from endpoint
  logs. The detection focuses on 'schtasks.exe' with an associated 'run' command.
  This activity is significant as adversaries often use it to force the execution
  of their created Scheduled Tasks for persistent access or lateral movement within
  a compromised machine. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to maintain
  persistence or move laterally within the network, potentially leading to further
  compromise.
