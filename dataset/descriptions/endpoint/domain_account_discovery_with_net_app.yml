description: The following analytic detects the execution of `net.exe` or `net1.exe`
  with command-line arguments used to query domain users. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line
  executions. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt by adversaries
  to enumerate domain users for situational awareness and Active Directory discovery.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to map out user accounts,
  potentially leading to further exploitation or lateral movement within the network.
