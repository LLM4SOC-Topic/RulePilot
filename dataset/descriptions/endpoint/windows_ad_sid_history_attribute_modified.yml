description: The following analytic detects modifications to the SID History attribute
  in Active Directory by leveraging event code 5136. This detection uses logs from
  the `wineventlog_security` data source to identify changes to the sIDHistory attribute.
  Monitoring this activity is crucial as the SID History attribute can be exploited
  by adversaries to inherit permissions from other accounts, potentially granting
  unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
  to maintain persistent access and escalate privileges within the domain, posing
  a significant security risk.
