description: The following analytic detects the usage of the SharpHound binary by
  identifying its original filename, `SharpHound.exe`, and the process name. This
  detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process metadata and command-line executions. SharpHound is a tool used for Active
  Directory enumeration, often by attackers during the reconnaissance phase. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to map out the network, identify
  high-value targets, and plan further attacks, potentially leading to privilege escalation
  and lateral movement within the environment.
