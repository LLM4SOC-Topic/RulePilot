description: The following analytic detects the use of the Enable-PSRemoting cmdlet,
  which allows PowerShell remoting on a local or remote computer. This detection leverages
  PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode 4104) to identify when this cmdlet is
  executed. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it can indicate an attacker enabling
  remote command execution capabilities on a compromised system. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow an attacker to take control of the system remotely, execute
  commands, and potentially pivot to other systems within the network, leading to
  further compromise and lateral movement.
