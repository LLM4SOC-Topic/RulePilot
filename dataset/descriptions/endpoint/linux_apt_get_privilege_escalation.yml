description: The following analytic detects the execution of the 'apt-get' command
  with elevated privileges using 'sudo' on a Linux system. It leverages data from
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs
  that include command-line details. This activity is significant because it indicates
  a user may be attempting to escalate privileges to root, which could lead to unauthorized
  system control. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain root access, allowing
  them to execute arbitrary commands, install or remove software, and potentially
  compromise the entire system.
