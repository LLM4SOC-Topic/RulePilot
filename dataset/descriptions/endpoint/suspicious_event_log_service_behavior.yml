description: The following analytic detects the shutdown of the Windows Event Log
  service using Windows Event ID 1100. This event is logged every time the service
  stops, including during normal system shutdowns. Monitoring this activity is crucial
  as it can indicate attempts to cover tracks or disable logging. If confirmed malicious,
  an attacker could hide their activities, making it difficult to trace their actions
  and investigate further incidents. Analysts should verify if the shutdown was planned
  and review other alerts and data sources for additional suspicious behavior.
