description: The following analytic detects excessive usage of `net.exe` or `net1.exe`
  within a one-minute interval. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, parent processes, and command-line executions.
  This behavior is significant as it may indicate an adversary attempting to create,
  delete, or disable multiple user accounts rapidly, a tactic observed in Monero mining
  incidents. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized user
  account manipulation, potentially compromising system integrity and enabling further
  malicious actions.
