description: The following analytic detects the use of the Win32_ScheduledJob WMI
  class via PowerShell script block logging. This class, which manages scheduled tasks,
  is disabled by default due to security concerns and must be explicitly enabled through
  registry modifications. The detection leverages PowerShell event code 4104 and script
  block text analysis. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it may indicate malicious
  intent, especially if the class was enabled by an attacker. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow attackers to persist in the environment by creating scheduled tasks.
