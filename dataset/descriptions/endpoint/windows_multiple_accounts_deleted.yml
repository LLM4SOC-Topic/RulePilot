description: The following analytic detects the deletion of more than five unique
  Windows accounts within a 10-minute period, using Event Code 4726 from the Windows
  Security Event Log. It leverages the `wineventlog_security` dataset, segmenting
  data into 10-minute intervals to identify suspicious account deletions. This activity
  is significant as it may indicate an attacker attempting to erase traces of their
  actions. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access removal,
  hindering incident response and forensic investigations.
