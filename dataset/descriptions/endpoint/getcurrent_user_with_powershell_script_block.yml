description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `GetCurrent` method
  from the WindowsIdentity .NET class using PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104).
  This method identifies the current Windows user. The detection leverages PowerShell
  script block logs to identify when this method is called. This activity is significant
  because adversaries and Red Teams may use it to gain situational awareness and perform
  Active Directory discovery on compromised endpoints. If confirmed malicious, this
  could allow attackers to map out user accounts and potentially escalate privileges
  or move laterally within the network.
