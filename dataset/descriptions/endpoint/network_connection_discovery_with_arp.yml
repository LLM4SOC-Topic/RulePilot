description: The following analytic detects the execution of `arp.exe` with the `-a`
  flag, which is used to list network connections on a compromised system. This detection
  leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process
  names, command-line executions, and related telemetry. Monitoring this activity
  is significant because both Red Teams and adversaries use `arp.exe` for situational
  awareness and Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow attackers to map the network, identify active devices, and plan further
  lateral movement or attacks.
