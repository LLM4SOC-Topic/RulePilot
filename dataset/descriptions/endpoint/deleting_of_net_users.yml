description: The following analytic detects the use of net.exe or net1.exe command-line
  to delete a user account on a system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and command-line execution logs.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to impair user accounts
  or cover tracks during lateral movement. If confirmed malicious, this could lead
  to unauthorized access removal, disruption of legitimate user activities, or concealment
  of adversarial actions, complicating incident response and forensic investigations.
