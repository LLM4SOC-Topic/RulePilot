description: The following analytic detects the execution of fodhelper.exe, which
  is known to exploit a User Account Control (UAC) bypass by leveraging specific registry
  keys. The detection method uses Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry
  to identify when fodhelper.exe spawns a child process and accesses the registry
  keys. This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation
  attempt by an attacker. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could execute commands
  with elevated privileges, leading to unauthorized system changes and potential full
  system compromise.
