description: The following analytic identifies a LOLBAS process being executed where
  it's process name does not match it's original file name attribute. Processes that
  have been renamed and executed may be an indicator that an adversary is attempting
  to evade defenses or execute malicious code. The LOLBAS project documents Windows
  native binaries that can be abused by threat actors to perform tasks like executing
  malicious code.
