description: The following analytic detects the use of `esentutl.exe` to access credentials
  stored in the ntds.dit or SAM file. This detection leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include
  command-line details. This activity is significant because it may indicate an attempt
  to extract sensitive credential information, which is a common tactic in lateral
  movement and privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker
  to gain unauthorized access to user credentials, potentially compromising the entire
  network.
