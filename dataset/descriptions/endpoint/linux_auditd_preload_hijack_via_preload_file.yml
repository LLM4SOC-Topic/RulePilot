description: The following analytic detects suspicious preload hijacking via the  `preload`
  file, which may indicate an attacker's attempt to intercept or manipulate library
  loading processes. The `preload` file can be used to force the loading of specific
  libraries before others, potentially allowing malicious code to execute or alter
  application behavior. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized modifications to
  the `preload` file, this analytic helps identify attempts to hijack preload mechanisms,
  enabling security teams to investigate and address potential threats to system integrity
  and security.
