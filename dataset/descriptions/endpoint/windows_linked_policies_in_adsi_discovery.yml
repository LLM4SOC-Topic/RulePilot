description: The following analytic detects the use of the `[Adsisearcher]` type accelerator
  in PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to query Active Directory for
  domain organizational units. This detection leverages PowerShell operational logs
  to identify script blocks containing `[adsisearcher]`, `objectcategory=organizationalunit`,
  and `findAll()`. This activity is significant as it indicates potential reconnaissance
  efforts by adversaries to gain situational awareness of the domain structure. If
  confirmed malicious, this could lead to further exploitation, such as privilege
  escalation or lateral movement within the network.
