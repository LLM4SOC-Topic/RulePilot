description: The following analytic detects the use of the `Enter-PSSession` cmdlet
  to establish an interactive session on a remote endpoint via the WinRM protocol.
  It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify this activity
  by searching for specific script block text patterns. This behavior is significant
  as it may indicate lateral movement or remote code execution attempts by adversaries.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to execute commands
  remotely, potentially leading to further compromise of the network and unauthorized
  access to sensitive information.
