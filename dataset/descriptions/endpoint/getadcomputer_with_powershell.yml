description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  the `Get-AdComputer` commandlet, which is used to discover remote systems within
  a domain. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant
  because it indicates potential reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to map out
  domain computers, which is a common step in the attack lifecycle. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could allow attackers to gain situational awareness and plan further
  attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data exfiltration.
