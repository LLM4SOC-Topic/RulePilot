description: The following analytic detects the execution of odbcconf.exe with a response
  file, which may contain commands to load a DLL (REGSVR) or other instructions. This
  detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant as it
  may indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code or load malicious DLLs, potentially
  leading to unauthorized actions. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker
  to gain code execution, escalate privileges, or establish persistence within the
  environment.
