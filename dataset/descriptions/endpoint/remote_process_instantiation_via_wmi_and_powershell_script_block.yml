description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `Invoke-WmiMethod`
  commandlet with parameters used to start a process on a remote endpoint via WMI,
  leveraging PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This method identifies
  specific script block text patterns associated with remote process instantiation.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate lateral movement or remote code
  execution attempts by adversaries. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to execute arbitrary code on remote systems, potentially leading to further compromise
  and persistence within the network.
