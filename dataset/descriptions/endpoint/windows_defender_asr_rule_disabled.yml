description: The following analytic identifies when a Windows Defender ASR rule disabled
  events. ASR is a feature of Windows Defender Exploit Guard that prevents actions
  and apps that are typically used by exploit-seeking malware to infect machines.
  ASR rules are applied to processes and applications. When a process or application
  attempts to perform an action that is blocked by an ASR rule, an event is generated.
  This detection searches for ASR rule disabled events that are generated when an
  ASR rule is disabled.
