description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  command-line arguments that utilize the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet and the `Win32_UserAccount`
  parameter to query local user accounts. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt by adversaries to enumerate
  user accounts for situational awareness or Active Directory discovery. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could lead to further reconnaissance, privilege escalation,
  or lateral movement within the network.
