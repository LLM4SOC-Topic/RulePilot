description: The following analytic detects the execution of wbadmin.exe with flags
  that delete backup files, specifically targeting catalog or system state backups.
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because it
  is commonly used by ransomware to prevent recovery by deleting system backups. If
  confirmed malicious, this action could severely hinder recovery efforts, leading
  to prolonged downtime and potential data loss.
