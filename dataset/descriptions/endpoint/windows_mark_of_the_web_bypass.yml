description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious process that deletes the
  Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) data stream. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 23 to detect when
  a file's Zone.Identifier stream is removed. This activity is significant because
  it is a common technique used by malware, such as Ave Maria RAT, to bypass security
  restrictions on files downloaded from the internet. If confirmed malicious, this
  behavior could allow an attacker to execute potentially harmful files without triggering
  security warnings, leading to further compromise of the system.
