description: The following analytic detects the creation of scheduled tasks on Windows
  systems that include HTTP command arguments, using Windows Security EventCode 4698.
  It identifies tasks registered via schtasks.exe or TaskService with HTTP in their
  command arguments. This behavior is significant as it often indicates malware activity
  or the use of Living off the Land binaries (lolbins) to download additional payloads.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to data exfiltration, malware propagation,
  or unauthorized access to sensitive information, necessitating immediate investigation
  and mitigation.
