description: The following analytic detects the execution of `net.exe` or `net1.exe`
  with command-line arguments `user` or `users` to query local user accounts. It leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names
  and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it indicates potential
  reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to enumerate local users, which is a common
  step in situational awareness and Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could lead to further attacks, including privilege escalation and
  lateral movement within the network.
