description: The following analytic detects the addition of NOPASSWD entries to the
  /etc/sudoers file on Linux systems. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) telemetry to identify command lines containing "NOPASSWD:". This activity
  is significant because it allows users to execute commands with elevated privileges
  without requiring a password, which can be exploited by adversaries to maintain
  persistent, privileged access. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  privilege escalation, persistent access, and potential compromise of sensitive data
  and system integrity.
