description: The following analytic detects the execution of JScript using the cscript.exe
  process. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process and command-line telemetry. This behavior is significant because JScript
  files are typically executed by wscript.exe, making cscript.exe execution unusual
  and potentially indicative of malicious activity, such as the FIN7 group's tactics.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  scripts, leading to code execution, data exfiltration, or further system compromise.
