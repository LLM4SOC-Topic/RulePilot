description: The following analytic identifies regsvcs.exe spawning a child process.
  This behavior is detected using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry,
  focusing on process creation events where the parent process is regsvcs.exe. This
  activity is significant because regsvcs.exe rarely spawns child processes, and such
  behavior can indicate an attempt to bypass application control mechanisms. If confirmed
  malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading
  to privilege escalation or persistent access within the environment. Immediate investigation
  is recommended to determine the legitimacy of the spawned process and any associated
  suspicious activities.
