description: The following analytic detects a suspicious process making DNS queries
  to known, abused text-paste web services, VoIP, instant messaging, and digital distribution
  platforms. It leverages Sysmon EventID 22 logs to identify queries from processes
  like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and others. This activity is significant as it may
  indicate an attempt to download malicious files, a common initial access technique.
  If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration,
  or further compromise of the target host.
