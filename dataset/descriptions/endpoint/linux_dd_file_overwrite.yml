description: The following analytic detects the use of the 'dd' command to overwrite
  files on a Linux system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include command-line details.
  This activity is significant because adversaries often use the 'dd' command to destroy
  or irreversibly overwrite files, disrupting system availability and services. If
  confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to data destruction, making recovery
  difficult and potentially causing significant operational disruptions.
