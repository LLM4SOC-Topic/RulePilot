description: The following analytic detects the use of the 'find' command with 'sudo'
  and '-exec' options, which can indicate an attempt to escalate privileges on a Linux
  system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process execution logs that include command-line arguments. This activity is
  significant because it can allow a user to execute system commands as root, potentially
  leading to a root shell. If confirmed malicious, this could enable an attacker to
  gain full control over the system, leading to severe security breaches and unauthorized
  access to sensitive data.
