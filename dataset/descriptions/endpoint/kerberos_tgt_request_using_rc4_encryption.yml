description: The following analytic detects a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)
  request using RC4-HMAC encryption (type 0x17) by leveraging Event 4768. This encryption
  type is outdated and its presence may indicate an OverPass The Hash attack. Monitoring
  this activity is crucial as it can signify credential theft, allowing adversaries
  to authenticate to the Kerberos Distribution Center (KDC) using a stolen NTLM hash.
  If confirmed malicious, this could enable unauthorized access to systems and resources,
  potentially leading to lateral movement and further compromise within the network.
