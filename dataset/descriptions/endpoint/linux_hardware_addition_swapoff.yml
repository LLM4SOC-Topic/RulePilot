description: The following analytic detects the execution of the "swapoff" command,
  which disables the swapping of paging devices on a Linux system. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution
  logs. This activity is significant because disabling swap can be a tactic used by
  malware, such as Awfulshred, to evade detection and hinder forensic analysis. If
  confirmed malicious, this action could allow an attacker to manipulate system memory
  management, potentially leading to data corruption, system instability, or evasion
  of memory-based detection mechanisms.
