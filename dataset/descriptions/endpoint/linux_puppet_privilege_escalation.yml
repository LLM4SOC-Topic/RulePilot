description: The following analytic detects the execution of Puppet commands with
  elevated privileges, specifically when Puppet is used to apply configurations with
  sudo rights. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include command-line details.
  This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation
  attempt, where a user could gain root access and execute system commands as the
  root user. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to fully compromise
  the system, execute arbitrary commands, and maintain persistent control.
