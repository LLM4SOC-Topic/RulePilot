description: The following analytic detects potentially malicious processes that initiate
  a ping delay using an invalid IP address. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions involving "ping 0
  -n". This behavior is significant as it is commonly used by malware like NJRAT to
  introduce time delays for evasion tactics, such as delaying self-deletion. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could indicate an active infection attempting to evade
  detection, potentially leading to further compromise and persistence within the
  environment.
