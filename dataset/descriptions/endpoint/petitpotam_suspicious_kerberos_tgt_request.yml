description: The following analytic detects a suspicious Kerberos Ticket Granting
  Ticket (TGT) request, identified by Event Code 4768. This detection leverages Windows
  Security Event Logs to identify TGT requests with unusual fields, which may indicate
  the use of tools like Rubeus following the exploitation of CVE-2021-36942 (PetitPotam).
  This activity is significant as it can signal an attacker leveraging a compromised
  certificate to request Kerberos tickets, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to escalate privileges and persist
  within the environment, posing a severe security risk.
