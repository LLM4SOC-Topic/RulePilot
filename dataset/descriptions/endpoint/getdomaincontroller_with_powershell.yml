description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  the `Get-DomainController` command, which is used to discover remote systems within
  a Windows domain. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. Monitoring this
  activity is crucial as it may indicate an attempt to enumerate domain controllers,
  a common tactic in Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow attackers to gain situational awareness, potentially leading to further
  exploitation and lateral movement within the network.
