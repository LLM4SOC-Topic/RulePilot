description: The following analytic identifies the creation of a new kernel mode driver
  using the sc.exe command. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include command-line
  details. The activity is significant because adding a kernel driver is uncommon
  in regular operations and can indicate an attempt to gain low-level access to the
  system. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute code with
  high privileges, potentially compromising the entire system and evading traditional
  security measures.
