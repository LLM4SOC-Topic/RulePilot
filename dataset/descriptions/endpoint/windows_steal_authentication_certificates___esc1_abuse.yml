description: The following analytic detects when a new certificate is requested or
  granted against Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) using a Subject Alternative
  Name (SAN). It leverages Windows Security Event Codes 4886 and 4887 to identify
  these actions. This activity is significant because improperly configured certificate
  templates can be exploited for privilege escalation and environment compromise.
  If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain elevated privileges or persist within
  the environment, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information
  and further exploitation.
