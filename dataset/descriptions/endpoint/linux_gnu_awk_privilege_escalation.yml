description: The following analytic detects the execution of the 'gawk' command with
  elevated privileges on a Linux system. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) telemetry to identify command-line executions where 'gawk' is used with 'sudo'
  and 'BEGIN{system' patterns. This activity is significant because it indicates a
  potential privilege escalation attempt, allowing a user to execute system commands
  as root. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full root access, enabling the
  attacker to control the system, modify critical files, and maintain persistent access.
