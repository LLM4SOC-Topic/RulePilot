description: The following analytic detects the execution of the GNU Debugger (GDB)
  with specific flags that indicate an attempt to escalate privileges on a Linux system.
  It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry to identify processes
  where GDB is run with the `-nx`, `-ex`, and `sudo` flags. This activity is significant
  because it can allow a user to execute system commands as root, potentially leading
  to a root shell. If confirmed malicious, this could result in full system compromise,
  allowing an attacker to gain complete control over the affected endpoint.
