description: The following analytic detects processes that clear or free page cache
  on a Linux system. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing
  on specific command-line executions involving the kernel system request `drop_caches`.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to delete forensic evidence
  or the presence of wiper malware like Awfulshred. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could allow an attacker to cover their tracks, making it difficult to investigate
  other malicious activities or system compromises.
