description: The following analytic detects the execution of a Unix shell command
  designed to wipe root directories on a Linux host. It leverages data from Linux
  Auditd, focusing on the 'rm' command with force recursive deletion and the '--no-preserve-root'
  option. This activity is significant as it indicates potential data destruction
  attempts, often associated with malware like Awfulshred. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could lead to severe data loss, system instability, and compromised
  integrity of the affected Linux host. Immediate investigation and response are crucial
  to mitigate potential damage.
