description: The following analytic identifies processes with command-line parameters
  associated with web browser credential dumping tools, specifically targeting behaviors
  used by Remcos RAT malware. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions and specific file paths. This
  activity is significant as it indicates potential credential theft, a common tactic
  in broader cyber-espionage campaigns. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain
  unauthorized access to sensitive web credentials, leading to further system compromise
  and data breaches.
