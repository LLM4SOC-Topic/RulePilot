description: The following analytic identifies the bootloader paths on Windows endpoints.
  It leverages a PowerShell Scripted input to capture this data, which is then processed
  and aggregated using Splunk. Monitoring bootloader paths is significant for a SOC
  as it helps detect unauthorized modifications that could indicate bootkits or other
  persistent threats. If confirmed malicious, such activity could allow attackers
  to maintain persistence, bypass security controls, and potentially control the boot
  process, leading to full system compromise.
