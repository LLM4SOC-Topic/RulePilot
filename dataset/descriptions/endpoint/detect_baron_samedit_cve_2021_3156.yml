description: The following analytic detects attempts to exploit the Baron Samedit
  vulnerability (CVE-2021-3156) by identifying the use of the "sudoedit -s \\" command.
  This detection leverages logs from Linux systems, specifically searching for instances
  of the sudoedit command with the "-s" flag followed by a double quote. This activity
  is significant because it indicates an attempt to exploit a known vulnerability
  that allows attackers to gain root privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could
  lead to complete system compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and potential
  data breaches.
