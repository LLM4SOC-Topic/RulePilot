description: The following analytic detects the execution of AutoIt3, a scripting
  language often used for automating Windows GUI tasks and general scripting. It identifies
  instances where AutoIt3 or its variants are executed by searching for process names
  or original file names matching 'autoit3.exe'. This activity is significant because
  attackers frequently use AutoIt3 to automate malicious actions, such as executing
  malware. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized code execution,
  system compromise, or further propagation of malware within the environment.
