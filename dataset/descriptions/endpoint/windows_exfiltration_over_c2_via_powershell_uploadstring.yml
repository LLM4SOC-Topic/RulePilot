description: The following analytic identifies potential data exfiltration using the
  PowerShell `net.webclient` command with the `UploadString` method. It leverages
  PowerShell Script Block Logging to detect instances where this command is executed.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to upload sensitive data,
  such as desktop screenshots or files, to an external or internal URI, often associated
  with malware like Winter-Vivern. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  data transfer, compromising sensitive information and potentially leading to further
  exploitation of the compromised host.
