description: The following analytic detects suspicious access or modification of the
  sshd_config file on Linux systems. It leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing
  on command-line executions involving processes like "cat," "nano," "vim," and "vi"
  accessing the sshd_config file. This activity is significant because unauthorized
  changes to sshd_config can allow threat actors to redirect port connections or use
  unauthorized keys, potentially compromising the system. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or persistent backdoor
  access, posing a severe security risk.
