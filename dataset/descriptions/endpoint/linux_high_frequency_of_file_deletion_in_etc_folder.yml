description: The following analytic detects a high frequency of file deletions in
  the /etc/ folder on Linux systems. It leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem data model
  to identify instances where 200 or more files are deleted within an hour, grouped
  by process name and process ID. This behavior is significant as it may indicate
  the presence of wiper malware, such as AcidRain, which aims to delete critical system
  files. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to severe system instability,
  data loss, and potential disruption of services.
