description: The following analytic detects non-Chrome processes accessing the Chrome
  "Local State" file, which contains critical settings and information. It leverages
  Windows Security Event logs, specifically event code 4663, to identify this behavior.
  This activity is significant because threat actors can exploit this file to extract
  the encrypted master key used for decrypting saved passwords in Chrome. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, posing
  a severe security risk. Monitoring this anomaly helps identify potential threats
  and safeguard browser-stored data.
