description: This analytic detects internal hosts triggering multiple IDS signatures,
  which may include either more than 25 signatures against a single host or a single
  signature across over 25 destination IP addresses. Such patterns can indicate active
  vulnerability scanning activities within the network. By monitoring IDS logs, this
  detection helps identify and respond to potential vulnerability scanning attempts,
  enhancing the network's security posture and preventing potential exploits.
