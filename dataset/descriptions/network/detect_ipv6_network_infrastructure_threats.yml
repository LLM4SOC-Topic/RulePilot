description: The following analytic detects IPv6 network infrastructure threats by
  identifying suspicious activities such as IP and MAC address theft or packet drops.
  It leverages logs from Cisco network devices configured with First Hop Security
  measures like RA Guard and DHCP Guard. This activity is significant as it can indicate
  attempts to compromise network integrity and security. If confirmed malicious, attackers
  could manipulate network traffic, leading to potential data interception, unauthorized
  access, or network disruption.
